# 2. Add Two Numbers
### Difficulty: Medium
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. <br/> You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4] <br/> Output: [7,0,8] <br/> Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0] <br/> Output: [0] <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9] <br/> Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1] <br/>   Constraints: <br/> The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100]. <br/> 0 <= Node.val <= 9 <br/> It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
