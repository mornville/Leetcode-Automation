# 24. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
### Difficulty: Medium
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values). <br/> Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]. <br/> Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums. <br/> You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0 <br/> Output: true <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3 <br/> Output: false <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= nums.length <= 5000 <br/> -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 <br/> nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot. <br/> -104 <= target <= 104 <br/>   Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
