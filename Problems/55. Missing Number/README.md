# 55. Missing Number
### Difficulty: Easy
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. <br/> Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity? <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: nums = [3,0,1] <br/> Output: 2 <br/> Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: nums = [0,1] <br/> Output: 2 <br/> Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 3: <br/> Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1] <br/> Output: 8 <br/> Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums. <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 4: <br/> Input: nums = [0] <br/> Output: 1 <br/> Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums. <br/>   Constraints: <br/> n == nums.length <br/> 1 <= n <= 104 <br/> 0 <= nums[i] <= n <br/> All the numbers of nums are unique.
