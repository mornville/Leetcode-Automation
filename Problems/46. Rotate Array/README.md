# 46. Rotate Array
### Difficulty: Medium
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. <br/>   <br/><b>- Example</b> 1: <br/> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 <br/> Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] <br/> Explanation: <br/> rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] <br/> rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5] <br/> rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] <br/> <br/><b>- Example</b> 2: <br/> Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2 <br/> Output: [3,99,-1,-100] <br/> Explanation:  <br/> rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3] <br/> rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100] <br/>   Constraints: <br/> 1 <= nums.length <= 105 <br/> -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1 <br/> 0 <= k <= 105 <br/>   Follow up: <br/> Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem. <br/> Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
